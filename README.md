# Code Assessment #

As part of our interview process, we'd like you complete this front-end development assessment.

## Instructions ##

1. Please first fork this repository*.

2. In the root directory you'll find “developerAssessment.pdf”. It contains a wireframe for a simple layout and instructions on how to complete the exercise.

3. Please don't use third-party scripts (with the exception of the core jQuery library, (a copy is included in the js folder, or feel free to link to the CDN) and think about reusable anonymous function coding. Any plugins or modules should be custom code written from scratch. Feel free to get creative!

4. Once you have completed your work, please share your forked repo with Erik Ralston at erik.ralston@guitarcenter.com.

We would like this returned within 48 hours. If you have a conflict and know you will need more time, please let us know up front.

*Guitar Center's email will block the zip file if sent as an attachment due to the files containing code, so if you have any problems forking the repository, or for some reason are unable to work with GIT locally, you may download the repository from the Downloads link at left, then contact erik.ralston@guitarcenter.com and we can transfer the zip through Dropbox.

Optionally, if you have your own GitHub account you can upload it there in lieu of using Bitbucket.
